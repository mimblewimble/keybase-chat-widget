A mitigation is for the user to keep re-establishing tor circuits (and addresses) in-between transactions. The service also gets information about the output commitments that goes on chain and can trivially link them to other commitments and to specific tor addresses. Unless the slates are e2ee? But that's not possible for this use case, right?\n\n\u003e Fortunately, this is just a temporary stopgap, and can be done away with once everyone starts supporting TOR.\n\nI would not call it temporary. I think with services like ngrok, hedwig, and this one reducing friction for http(s) transactions, there's less incentive for exchanges to put in effort to improve their systems. There's really no need for them to. So in my mind, it will be less a case of \"once everyone starts supporting TOR\" as that is not going to happen on it's own.
